So after browsing the internet i decided to buy a pcb that has esp01 and relay attached. 
<span class="more"></span>
Neat and clean, saves me time to make the hardware. But little did i know what i was getting into, A time saver lead me to unknowingly buy a LC tech smart relay clone.

Anyways, I got my arduino setup and ready to flash to tasmota firmware.


The process was quite time talking for me, I use openrc and was having some issues on my os. 
I do not like systemd, but anyway's after getting everything to work i finnaly flashed the firware on the esp01

Next up since this is a clone and a bad one, i had to find some rules to make the relay actually work. 
A little internet browsing and i found one that worked. 

Then i installed home assistant because that's what i want to use.

Now i just need to hook this up to my AC main and done.
